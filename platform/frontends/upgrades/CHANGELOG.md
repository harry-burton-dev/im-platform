## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- 024e635: Preferences are never saved over before they have loaded, and telemetry starting no longer remounts the open app. Notifications aren't lost on reconnect, Home's cards unmount on a floor change, the leaver form keeps the agreed handover, Organisation says plainly that leavers are deleted, and failed reads no longer stop job tracking or hide installed apps.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 6236e98: A deployment can choose how depth is drawn behind dialogs, menus and the palette (ADR 0068, PDR-010 amendment 2): `FOCUS_DEPTH` (`veil`, `lens` or `scrim`) reaches the shell's page as an `augur-depth` meta, which Quill reads for the shell and every app. `scrim` blurs nothing, for desktops without a GPU. Unset, each app chooses as before.

  Serves Quill 0.11.0 (Common 0.9.0, kit bundle 0.5.6), which reads it, and PDR-010's tile amendments: a dimmer document tile and a "more" mark on tiles.

- c80a122: The Upgrade Centre no longer lists the Common kit as its own dependency: it uses it only through Quill.
- Updated dependencies [8eba62b]
  - @augur/mfe-sdk@2.1.0

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 21ee89a: Serve Quill 0.8.0 (kit bundle 0.5.3): its dates follow each person's `ctx.formats` (PER-323), and `AppError` reads a service's problem as AUGUR sends it.
- 1e58d38: A printable card for the admin who wakes to an upgrade that went back by itself, didn't install, or kept running after its watch saw a problem: docs/upgrade-went-back.md. The updater's, the after-watch's and the Upgrade Centre's messages now point at it. deploy.md's restore now stops everything but Postgres, as its words always said.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- eb6aed9: AUGUR serves kit 0.5.1 (Quill 0.7.0, Aerie 0.6.0): apps get the Tiptap editor with mentions as chips (ADR 0058), a date field with a real calendar, and the people picker that SDK 1.12's `searchPrincipals` answers. In Admin, the activity filters' dates open that calendar.
- 8606741: The registry sends its signed record to Backstage at least every 15 minutes, not once a day, so Backstage can raise the alarm when a deployment goes quiet (ADR 0059). The record's reason for a send with nothing new is `heartbeat` (contract 1.32.0), and the Upgrade Centre calls it the regular record.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 2eae812: AUGUR serves kit 0.4.0 (Common 0.6.0, Quill 0.6.0) and the shell draws on Aerie 0.5.0. Apps' frames keep one layout at every width and fold their drawer and rail over the page when narrow; the floor gauge keeps a lane of its own, so it never covers an app; danger actions can ask twice; Reduce motion stops every loop; and floors move with Alt+Page Up and Alt+Page Down, leaving Page Up and Page Down to the app.
- 8a161b9: AUGUR serves kit 0.5.0 (Common 0.7.0, Quill 0.6.1) and the shell draws on Aerie 0.5.1. The kit now brings its own typefaces (Jost and Nunito, served with the kit at `KIT_URL`) and its reduced-motion values, so a deployment that serves the kit from another site shows the same type and calms the same moves.
- cbbefd9: The Upgrade Centre can install a halted AUGUR release for a test on Workbench and Preview servers (ADR 0051). Beside a halted release, "Install … for a test" says why the publisher halted it, asks for a reason for the audit log, and follows the upgrade step by step; the watch judges it and AUGUR goes back by itself if it fails. On a Production server, or with a registry too old for it, the action stays visible and says why it can't be used.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 35547f6: The React kits (Common, Quill and Aerie) now come from the augur-kit repository as packages (ADR 0046), and are AUGUR release parts at the versions installed. Their Storybook and Chromatic run there.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9e021dd]
  - @augur/app-kit@0.3.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1743f40: Automatic waits until an admin has upgraded AUGUR on a server once, and a 0.x minor counts as a major for AUGUR and apps (ADR 0020, amended). ADR 0045 is accepted.
- 7dffd91: A watch too quiet to judge errors by keeps going lightly until AUGUR's services have had 20 calls, for up to a day. A problem it finds then shows in Needs you and doesn't go back by itself (ADR 0020, amended).
- 567b4ca: Upgrade AUGUR, go back, and install an app's release from the Upgrade Centre, then follow the upgrade step by step until it ends. When the registry asks for the password again, the page signs in again and comes back to the same question with what was typed kept for the tab.
- aa1546f: The Upgrade Centre's history lists AUGUR's upgrades, every app's installs and removals, and every change of settings with the sentence before and after, newest first. It filters by unit, by who started it (a person, By itself or Watch) and by outcome, and exports as CSV.
- 854b1c7: Start the Upgrade Centre frontend with its API client and state model: unit states, Needs you, maintenance windows, pins and the policy sentence.
- 57e4775: The Upgrade Centre reads the registry's overview: each unit's policy in a sentence, what Automatic will do next, the next window, and Needs you from the server. Marking a failed or went-back result looked at clears it for every admin.
- 860f90b: The Upgrade Centre draws on Quill: the app frame with a rail of units and History, a front page (Needs you, On offer, Worth knowing), an About drawer on each unit, and Common's buttons, choices, fields and select. Its name and icon come from the manifest.
- aa1546f: The Upgrade Centre shows how the deployment reports to Backstage: why it's on, off or file-only, its name in Backstage, the public key to copy into `augur.dev/report-key`, how the last send went, and an export of the signed record.
- 8b6525f: The Upgrade Centre opens as its own app at /upgrades (ADR 0030): an overview (Needs you, this deployment, units, next window, last checked), a page for AUGUR and each installed app (how it moves, what is on offer, going back) and the history. Changes still go through Admin, Upgrade Centre until the change flow ships.
- 3a56e07: Change a unit's settings from the Upgrade Centre: channel, Automatic / Ask first / Hold, how far Automatic goes, a pin, and weekly windows in a time zone. The sentence before and after, and the next three windows, show before saving.

  "I've looked at this" works for any admin again, as the registry allows; only changes need `deployment-admin`.

### Patch Changes

- d500567: Home is on React and Quill (ADR 0015): the same greeting, list of what needs you and glance cards. The Upgrade Centre's status marks are Quill's own, so it no longer loads the Lit kit.
- 3d000f8: After an upgrade to a newer release, the updater watches it for 10 minutes before calling it done: sign-in must keep answering and no more than 5% of the gateway's calls may fail (ADR 0020). If either fails it goes back by itself, unless a breaking release lies between, when it leaves the release running and says so. The registry asks for the watch with each forward upgrade, and the new watch step is listed.
- 6a7d54b: A server built from source (compose.build.yml) says so: the registry reports `running.build: 'source'`, and the Upgrade Centre and Admin show AUGUR as built from source, based on the last release, instead of looking like an out-of-date release.
