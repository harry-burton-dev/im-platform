# @augur/shell

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ce4194: Urgent news (ADR 0044 D3, PER-283). A notification can be `urgent`, from AUGUR's own services only (an app's is refused, 403). The Upgrade Centre marks a halted release and a go-back that didn't finish urgent, and offers a feature preview, `urgent-letterbox`: with it on, the shell opens urgent news in a see-through letterbox over the work, one at a time with the rest in its queue, and steps it back to the edge rule until someone opens it. Events contract 1.14.0.

  Not breaking: `NewNotification.urgent` in `@augur/service-kit` is a new optional field, so existing callers build and send as before.

### Patch Changes

- 024e635: Preferences are never saved over before they have loaded, and telemetry starting no longer remounts the open app. Notifications aren't lost on reconnect, Home's cards unmount on a floor change, the leaver form keeps the agreed handover, Organisation says plainly that leavers are deleted, and failed reads no longer stop job tracking or hide installed apps.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- dec8350: Home puts the cards of apps for the work (pillar apps and every other app) before platform apps' cards, among apps not opened lately (PER-179, ADR 0032).
- f4b3551: A notice email's link opens its notification in the shell, on its floor. Account → Notifications says whether email
  reaches you, and if not why: no mail relay on the deployment, no address yet, or an address not checked yet.
- 32f90b8: People are emailed when their password, code app or passkeys change. With a relay, the realm job turns on Keycloak's email listener, and AUGUR's Keycloak image leaves failed sign-ins out. Identity's `GET /v1/me/security` says whether those emails are on and where they go (contract 1.25.0), and Account → Sign-in and security says so. Until people choose a time zone of their own, times follow the organisation's time zone from Admin → Organisation, and then the browser's. Account → Language and region says which one they follow.
- 6196c61: Account → About and help says what's new in the release, for people: Ibis's highlights, with the deployment's own name for AUGUR in them. A guide for alpha testers, docs/alpha-testers.md, says what to try, what doesn't work yet and how to report a problem.

### Patch Changes

- 2b58f5f: The Inbox's Done tab looks back `INBOX_DONE_DAYS` days (30 by default) instead of a fixed 30. `GET /v1/inbox/counts` now says the window as `doneDays` (events API 1.12.0), and the shell's empty Done tab reads its number from there instead of repeating it.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 6236e98: A deployment can choose how depth is drawn behind dialogs, menus and the palette (ADR 0068, PDR-010 amendment 2): `FOCUS_DEPTH` (`veil`, `lens` or `scrim`) reaches the shell's page as an `augur-depth` meta, which Quill reads for the shell and every app. `scrim` blurs nothing, for desktops without a GPU. Unset, each app chooses as before.

  Serves Quill 0.11.0 (Common 0.9.0, kit bundle 0.5.6), which reads it, and PDR-010's tile amendments: a dimmer document tile and a "more" mark on tiles.

### Patch Changes

  - @augur/mfe-sdk@2.1.0

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 5be0fd6: The design direction behind feature previews (PER-283). AUGUR's own apps can offer feature previews: they stay at the server's default (opt-in on a dev or preview server, off on a production one), people turn them on in Previews, and Admin says why it can't change them. Home offers two, both off until someone turns them on: `focal-planes` (what needs you comes forward, with its count in light and words, and the glance cards go quiet) and `radial-menu` (each thing that needs you opens its actions in a ring: right-click, a long press, or its "more" mark).

  The shell serves kit 0.5.4 (Common 0.8.0, Quill 0.9.0), which brings the design picks' parts, each off until an app turns it on.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d5b585: Account's Home and apps section: the floor AUGUR opens on, pinned apps first on Home and in the list of apps, clearing recent apps, and each app's own `settings` surface. Identity's preferences keep `pinned` and `startFloor`.
- 54b0d26: Account, Language and region: choose your language from the ones the deployment offers (`REALM_LANGUAGES`, which identity now reads too; kept as the profile's `locale`, so sign-in pages and emails follow it), how dates and times are written (`dateFormat` and `clock` preferences), with examples. The shell writes its dates and times their way, in their time zone. Part of PER-193.
- eac9902: Account gets Privacy and data: download a copy of what AUGUR keeps about you (identity `GET /me/data`, with events' notifications, inbox and Activity from `GET /v1/people/{id}/data`), see who sees what about you, and ask to leave or take it back (`/me/leave`; admins are told once). Part of PER-193.
- f12bbaf: Apps get the person's date formats (PER-323): `ctx.formats` (SDK 2.0) carries their `language`, the `locale` to write dates in, their `timeZone` and `hourCycle`, read live from Account's Language and region. Additive: an older shell leaves it out.
- cbd1abc: SDK 2 drops Lit and the Lit kit (`@augur/ui-kit`, PER-264). The shell no longer builds or serves them: its import map holds React, Common and Quill from the kit bundle, and in production the shell's own stand-in for `react/jsx-dev-runtime` at `/shared/`. The shell's build stops if the pinned kit doesn't serve every module the SDK promises apps. An app that still imports `lit` or `@augur/ui-kit` doesn't load. The typefaces (Jost and Nunito) now come with the kit's styles (kit 0.5.0). `pnpm dev:app` drops its `--kit` switch, and the registry takes a `.tsx` entry for Live on the workbench. `pnpm check:boundaries` fails on any import of Lit or the Lit kit under `platform/`.
- 04d7ed1: Choosing notifications per kind (ADR 0036). The events service keeps a notification's `kind` and refuses one the app's manifest doesn't declare (migration 008). Identity's preferences keep `quietKinds` (`<app>:<kind>`). Account, Notifications lists each app's kinds, On Home or Quiet, and the shell lands a quiet kind in the stream without a pulse, uncounted, off Home and with no toast (Aerie 0.7.0). The service kit's `NewNotification` and `AppNotice` take `kind`.

### Patch Changes

- 1f3bcfd: Agents, not built yet, now look unavailable on the Shell's arc and say why on hover and focus, instead of opening a dialog when pressed.
- fe3d68a: `pnpm dev:app` keeps a stand-in inbox, filled from the browser console, and the contract tests check the Inbox through it: an item shows in the app's words, Open raises its intent, Home lists it, and what the app doesn’t allow stays in the menu saying why. Each Inbox row’s More now opens its menu from a button.
- 21ee89a: Serve Quill 0.8.0 (kit bundle 0.5.3): its dates follow each person's `ctx.formats` (PER-323), and `AppError` reads a service's problem as AUGUR sends it.
- 9d8c0ed: `pnpm dev:app`'s stand-in Home, and the shell's and registry's test apps, accept SDK 2 as well as 1, so they still open once the SDK is 2.0.0.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 304aee2: The shell's Account area (ADR 0036, PER-191): Account on the arc opens Profile, Sign-in and security (with where you're signed in and recent sign-ins), Notifications, Appearance, Language and region, and About and help, over whatever is on screen. Credential changes open Keycloak's own screens and come back. Settings is folded into Appearance.
- 7599be1: The Inbox in the shell (ADR 0026, PER-146): a function after Find whose label carries the count ("Inbox 3"), and a view with For you, Your teams and Done. Each row says which app and kind it's from, what it's about and when it's due, with Open (raising the item's intent, or opening its app at its path, on its own floor) and a menu to take it, give it back, hand it on to a person or team, decline it with a reason, or mark it done where the app allows. Anything that can't be done stays, disabled, saying why. Home lists the first five open items on its floor above the notifications that need you. The count and the list stay live from the notification stream's `inbox` events.
- eb6aed9: AUGUR serves kit 0.5.1 (Quill 0.7.0, Aerie 0.6.0): apps get the Tiptap editor with mentions as chips (ADR 0058), a date field with a real calendar, and the people picker that SDK 1.12's `searchPrincipals` answers. In Admin, the activity filters' dates open that calendar.
- 0b8018d: With the kit's accessibility pass (kit 0.4.0 and later), the shell's stage is the page's one `main` landmark, named for the open app; a new thing that needs you is said once by a polite live region; every icon-only control in the band shows its name on hover and focus; Reduce motion stops every loop; and floors move with Alt+Page Up and Alt+Page Down, leaving Page Up and Page Down to the app. In Admin, turning off someone's sign-in, giving them a new one-time password, turning an app off and removing a site apps load from each ask twice in place (`AskTwice`) instead of opening a confirmation. The contract job runs axe on the shell and fails on any serious finding (ADR 0063).
- dcae52f: The product's name is a deployment setting, `ORG_PRODUCT_NAME` (default AUGUR). The web container writes it into the shell's page, so the browser tab says it, and the realm job makes it the realm's display name, so the sign-in pages, Keycloak's emails (their subjects and AUGUR's layout) and passkey prompts show it.
- 81041b0: The shell runs Grafana Faro once someone is signed in, when the deployment collects browser telemetry (ADR 0059): errors from the shell and every app, each put down to its app and version, and a trace for each call a page makes, sent through the gateway with nothing that names a person.

### Patch Changes

- b4cad59: Feature previews can be turned on for chosen floors: Admin → Apps picks the floors, the preview is on there and on the floors beneath them, and off everywhere else, without a release (ADR 0021, amended). `ctx.previewOn` is unchanged; an app's service passes `?workspace=` when it asks the registry for a person.
- Updated dependencies [7518ce8]
- Updated dependencies [cceb953]
  - @augur/mfe-sdk@1.12.0

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ad27cc: Back and Forward inside an app no longer throw away what it holds (PER-308). SDK 1.11 adds `followsAddress` to the manifest, for an app that follows the address itself, and `navigated(el, path)` on the app. While an app with both stays open on the same floor and nothing is waiting for it, the shell keeps it mounted on a move inside its route and calls `navigated` with the new path; an intent, a request, another floor or a changed preview still mounts it again. An app without `navigated` is mounted again as before, since the shell's own moves push the address without a popstate. The registry accepts the flag (contract 1.33.0).
- 2eae812: AUGUR serves kit 0.4.0 (Common 0.6.0, Quill 0.6.0) and the shell draws on Aerie 0.5.0. Apps' frames keep one layout at every width and fold their drawer and rail over the page when narrow; the floor gauge keeps a lane of its own, so it never covers an app; danger actions can ask twice; Reduce motion stops every loop; and floors move with Alt+Page Up and Alt+Page Down, leaving Page Up and Page Down to the app.
- 8a161b9: AUGUR serves kit 0.5.0 (Common 0.7.0, Quill 0.6.1) and the shell draws on Aerie 0.5.1. The kit now brings its own typefaces (Jost and Nunito, served with the kit at `KIT_URL`) and its reduced-motion values, so a deployment that serves the kit from another site shows the same type and calms the same moves.
- 86c3cd1: The shell follows the events service's browser stream once, for the floor the person is on and the topics of the apps they have there (and `platform.*`), and puts each domain event on `ctx.bus` under its topic, so the app kit's `useData(…, { refreshOn })` refreshes without polling. `pnpm dev:app` stands in for the stream: send an event from the console with `augur:dev-domain-event`. The contract tests check an app reloads when one arrives.

### Patch Changes

- 2ad8555: `ctx.fetch` adds the person's token and the floor only to requests for AUGUR's own origin (the gateway); a request to another site goes without them, so an app fetching a public resource never hands it the person's sign-in. The production import map's `react/jsx-dev-runtime` now has a working `jsxDEV` (made from `jsx`), so an app built in development mode renders against a production shell.
- 46f349a: The shell's Content Security Policy lets fonts load from the kit's site as well as AUGUR's own, so the kit's typefaces arrive when KIT_URL points elsewhere, and from nowhere else. The app patterns guide gains the one-layout-at-every-width rule.
- 8d48714: Fixes from the 2 Nov audit. In Admin → People, a person's sign-in (on or off, a new one-time password) sits in its own section that says it takes effect at once: each asks first, acts straight away and says what happened, while their name, email, department and roles change only on Save. Agents stay among the Shell's functions and say they aren't here yet, and Home keeps the card of an app this shell can't open, saying why and who can change it, instead of hiding either. Messages people read say AUGUR, not "the platform", and `pnpm check:reasons` now catches it. The centre menu's transitions stop for AUGUR's own reduced-motion setting as well as the system's and are timed from motion tokens; the lifecycle's divider uses the hairline token; overlay shadows use the shadow token. A new test holds the Lit kit and AUGUR's frontends to tokens only.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 35547f6: The shell and every app load the UI kit (React, Common and Quill) from the kit bundle this release pins in release/kit.json, served at KIT_URL: by default /kit/ on the front door, or any host that mirrors it, such as a CDN (ADR 0048). Each kit file is held to its hash, Settings shows the kit and where it comes from, and the page says so, naming KIT_URL, if the kit can't be loaded.

### Patch Changes

- 35547f6: The React kits (Common, Quill and Aerie) now come from the augur-kit repository as packages (ADR 0046), and are AUGUR release parts at the versions installed. Their Storybook and Chromatic run there.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- c6640ee: The web image takes Alpine's security fixes when it is built, which fixes a critical brotli flaw (CVE-2026-111497) in 0.16.0.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- a19adb5: The shell is drawn in React on Aerie: the band, the floor gauge, the sky and its views (`Shell` with a `ShellModel`), Title and Orbit (`CentreMenu`), the water, and the request and previews dialogs on Common. The shell's own UI no longer uses the Lit kit; `@augur/ui-kit` is still served to apps through the import map until SDK 2.

### Patch Changes

  - @augur/app-kit@0.3.0

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- fccb126: The React kits begin (ADR 0015). Three new packages: Common (`@augur/kit-common`), which now holds the token files and builds a Tailwind v4 theme from them with nothing of Tailwind's own palette or scales; Quill (`@augur/app-kit`), the kit apps build with; and Aerie (`@augur/shell-kit`), the shell's own kit. The shell now serves React 19, Common and Quill through the import map (`sharedModules` in the SDK), and uses that copy of React itself. Aerie is never shared, and `pnpm check:boundaries` fails if anything but the shell imports it. The Lit kit is frozen through SDK 1.x and reads its tokens from Common; nothing looks different.
- bab2360: Settings has a new switch, Toasts for new notifications, which is off by default. When it's on, each new notification is also shown once as an Aerie toast at the bottom of the screen, with Open. When it's off, the shell behaves as it does today: it only pulses. Identity keeps the choice as the `toasts` preference (identity contract 1.13.0).

### Patch Changes

- d994d7b: Common gets its first React controls: Button, IconButton and Icon, with React Aria behaviour, Lucide icons, a reason for every disabled control and `kit.css` for their styles. The shell loads `kit.css`. One Storybook in `platform/storybook` now shows the React kits, with the frozen Lit kit inside it.
- cccd9ea: Tokens now live in three W3C design token files (`tokens/common.tokens.json`, `shell.tokens.json`, `app.tokens.json`) and are built with Style Dictionary. Every CSS variable and token value is unchanged. The typefaces are now served by AUGUR through Fontsource instead of loading from Google Fonts at runtime, so a deployment without internet access still shows them. While an app's title card plays, the screen waiting unseen behind it can no longer be pressed; before, a press could land on a control that was about to rise into place.
- f8e9b46: Quill gets its first parts: AppFrame (three columns with a rail that folds to icons, the app's name opening its front page, and a drawer), RailLink, FrontPage, About, More and SelectionBar. Quill re-exports Common, and the shell loads Quill's `kit.css`. The tokens-only test now covers every kit's source.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a55170: Live on the workbench: `pnpm dev:app <id> --live` loads your app's frontend, from source on your machine over the tailnet, into the workbench's real shell, with real sign-in, floors and data, for you alone. Paste the address it prints into Previews, **Live from my machine**. Only an app's developers can, and only on the workbench (`SERVER_RING=dev`), where the front door's Content Security Policy allows `https://*.ts.net`; elsewhere Previews says why (docs/release-channels.md, "Live on the workbench").
- 5ab5009: Departments and teams are now two different levels. Teams right below the org are Departments, and those inside them are Teams. An admin can rename the levels, up to five, in Admin → Departments → Level names. The new `GET`/`PUT /v1/admin/levels` endpoints are audited as `levels.renamed` (identity contract 1.12.0), and a level deeper than the last name takes that name.

  Each floor's `level` reaches the shell and apps: identity's floors, and `WorkspaceRef.level` in SDK 1.9. Apps can say it where they'd say "team", and `kind` stays `team` at every level, so no app breaks.

  The shell names the level on the title card, the gauge, Account and the top left. A department also has its own icon and water colours, from the new tokens `floor-department-low` (violet) and `floor-department-high` (lavender, also its gauge mark). The kit adds `floorTone()`, `floorKindOf()`, `floorIconOf()` and `teamDepth()`, and `ShellFloorRef.level`.

### Patch Changes

- 2a05a51: Artifacts gets the three-column app layout from the live session with Harry: a rail that folds to icons (the app's name on top opens its front page, then Your collections, Shared libraries, From below, and the open collection), the content in the middle with Back above its title and a search above the grid, and a drawer on the right that says what's on screen. Collections, folders and documents are tiles that answer hover by rank; right-click one, or the empty grid, for a ring of what can be done with it. The front page shows only what needs you, what's new, and your collections. What was "Published to you" sits under Shared libraries. The reader keeps its facts and actions in the drawer too.

  New in the kit: `ui-tile`/`ui-tiles`, `ui-toolbar`, `ui-radial-menu`, and `ui-app-frame` gains a folding rail and a drawer. `pnpm dev:app` now runs on Windows.

- b72d1df: The front door now sends text compressed (gzip): the shell, the kit and apps' bundles go out at about a third of their size (the kit 429 kB → 127 kB). The notification stream isn't compressed, so it's never held back.

### Minor Changes

- 5b2c80c: Feature previews (SDK 1.7): an app lists features it's trying in its manifest's `previews` and asks `ctx.previewOn(id)`. Admins choose who gets each in Admin → Apps (off, for those who turn it on, or everyone; opt-in by default on a preview server, off on a production one), people turn opt-in ones on in the shell's Previews, and the shell marks an app with one on. A preview past its `until` day is off for everyone. Registry contract 1.27.0 (docs/release-channels.md, "Feature previews").

### Patch Changes

- 5119d47: The live dev loop: `pnpm dev:app <id> --kit` rebuilds the UI kit, its tokens and the shared modules as you change them and reloads the page; `DEV_PREVIEWS` turns an app's feature previews on in the stand-in; `DEV_HOST` opens the dev server to the tailnet. Each pull request's CI keeps its Storybook as an artifact (docs/release-channels.md, "The live dev loop").

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 2c9caf0: App kit, part 1: nothing is obtuse. `ui-button` and `ui-icon-button` take a `reason`: disabled with one, they stay focusable and say why on hover and focus, and it's read aloud. List rows, list actions and menu entries take a `reason` too. The kit warns on localhost about a disabled control without one, and `pnpm check:reasons` fails a platform screen that has one. New parts: `ui-notice` (one sentence that needs attention, with one action), `ui-note` (a quiet line with its `why` one press away) and `ui-can` (what you can do here, and who can do the rest). Every disabled control in Admin, the shell, Artifacts, Mandate and Data Atlas now says why, and ones that were only waiting for a request show as busy instead.
- 858b234: An app answering a request (a picker, or any app opened over another) is mounted once per request. Before, the catalogue loading again while its dialog was open mounted it a second time, so whatever the person had started in it was lost.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d68128b: Every app now stands on the same ground, the flat slate Artifacts is drawn on, instead of on the Calm Tide water. Title and Orbit keep their water. `ui-shell`'s still ground (`background="none"`) is that flat slate now. Moving to another floor while inside an app no longer shows the water during the move, because the ground stays as it was while the next floor's catalogue loads.
- 7ee3531: Back in the top bar is gone. Beside the floor, two round buttons go to **Home** and to **All apps** (Title) from any screen, inside an app or not, and the one you're on is marked. On a floor without Home, Home stays and says why. New `ui-shell` property `navs` (`ShellNav[]`) and event `ui-nav`; `backTo` and `ui-back` still work for a host that sets them, but the shell no longer does. This also fixes the way out of an app opened from Title or Orbit doing nothing, because the shell still thought the move in was under way. Esc goes up one level as before.
- a9cfcf7: The floor gauge opens out smoothly. Pointing at it or tabbing into it, each floor's label grows from nothing to its size while it fades in, the gaps widen, and the pinned app icon shrinks away, so nothing jumps. It closes the same way. In an app that shows the same on every floor, the gauge rests: it stays in view, dimmed, and pointing at it says why, and Page Up and Page Down don't move floors. Apps say this with the new manifest field `sameOnEveryFloor` (SDK 1.6, registry contract 1.22.0), and Admin sets it. `ShellApp` gains `sameOnEveryFloor`, and `ui-shell` gains `floorsRest`.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1580b6b: Title shows what an app covers, not how to get around in it. An app may name up to six `areas` in its manifest (SDK 1.5), and each menu group its `area`. Title lists an app's areas, each opening its Orbit at the area's first group; an app with one area or none is a choice by itself, captioned with its description, so nothing is offered twice. Orbit keeps an area's groups together and names the area before the group ("Organisation / People"), and the area sits under the app's name below the handle. A group with one page is that page. Nothing repeats the label or icon of what it sits under: the registry warns when a manifest does (`menuWarnings`, also printed by `pnpm check:manifest`) and still accepts it. Admin has two areas, Organisation and System, with new kit icons `list`, `structure`, `server` and `gauge`. `ui-centre-menu` takes a category with no items as a choice by itself, and a category `section` that Orbit names before it.
- 8f69cb5: Moving between floors travels: what you're looking at leaves the way you're going (going up, it sinks away; going down, it rises away; across, it slides aside), the host waits for that before taking the app down, and the next floor comes in from the other side. Each arrival plays an area title card in place of the floor-name pill: the kind of floor, its name set large, and who sees what's there. Opening an app plays its card too, the app's name under the floor it opened on, once per app rather than on every page. Cards are built from the floor or app, never written by hand, leave off a kicker that would only repeat the name, ignore the pointer, end on any key, press or scroll, and fade out where they are. A new Area titles switch in Settings turns them off, saved with a person's preferences (`areaTitles` in Identity). `ui-shell` gains `leaveFloor()`; new tokens `travel-floor` (96px) and `motion-title` (2400ms); kit exports `floorKindName` and `FloorDirection`. Under reduced motion nothing travels and cards appear and fade in place.
- ae92eed: Moving between Title, Orbit and an app is one motion: what you chose is carried from where it was to where it lands. The menu steps aside (deeper into Title or Orbit, or down on Back), the chosen icon or app name flies to its place on the next screen, and an opened app rises a short way into place while its surfaces settle in one after another. Leaving an app sinks it before Orbit comes back. A key or press during a move jumps it to its end, and "Opening…" shows only when an app takes longer than 400ms. New kit `motion.ts` exports `motionMode()`, `liftGhost()`, `finishMotion()` and `moving()`; `ui-shell` gains `arrive()`, `sink()`, `settleStage()` and `placeTitle`, and `ui-centre-menu` gains `leave()`, `focusedIcon()` and `focusedRect()`. Reduced motion is one switch: the system setting or `data-motion="reduce"` sets every motion token near zero in the kit's base styles, stops loops, and leaves only crossfades. New token `travel-near` (24px).
- 28d8775: The shell's top bar is chrome, never a surface. On every screen it rests on a fade of the new `scrim` token over the water or the app, and Title's letterbox is a fade too, so the water shows through. Top left shows only the floor you're on, its icon and name, with no breadcrumb path. While an app is open, its name sits under the look-up handle (`area` adds the part of it you're in), and the handle takes the floor's colour. **Back** (`backTo`, `ui-back`) replaces All apps (`ui-home`): it goes up one level, the same as Esc, worked out from where you are rather than per app. The app's top edge fades in under the band, and the tab's title names the page, app and floor.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9dfd714: The front door holds callers to limits. Keycloak's own admin console and its `master` realm answer 404 unless `KEYCLOAK_CONSOLE=open`. Each address gets a request rate for the API (`API_RATE_PER_SECOND`, `API_RATE_BURST`) and for sign-in (`SSO_RATE_PER_SECOND`, `SSO_RATE_BURST`), and is answered 429 past it. The address comes from `X-Forwarded-For`, which is believed only from private addresses. The largest upload is `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`. See docs/deploy.md, "Limits at the front door".

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 70df61e: An app can keep its menu inside it: `"orbit": false` in its manifest (SDK 1.4) means the shell never shows its Orbit. Its root opens the app, Title still lists its menu and opens the chosen category's first page, and Esc stays with the app. The band now names the open app after the floor, with **All apps** (`ui-home`) as the deliberate way back to Title. The floor gauge pins the open app beside the floor you're on and, pointed at or tabbed into, opens out to say what each floor is, who sees it, and which one the app is showing; Account's floor list says the same. Changing floor no longer mounts the app twice, once against the last floor's catalogue: nothing of the old floor's stays mounted until the new floor's catalogue arrives.
- aa0f0f4: An app's developers get Previews in the shell's band: each of their apps' pull requests' previews running on the server, to switch to for themselves and back. While one is in use, the shell says so at the bottom of the screen, with a link to the pull request and the way back. The kit gains a `preview` icon.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 94d0c0c: Folio ships with AUGUR. The release builds its images and pins its version, the deploy stack runs it (`folio`, `folio-worker`, its frontend in `web`) and it registers itself on first start with no admin step. The registry's `PILLAR_APPS` are given the scopes their release asks for, can't be pinned to a version, and can be turned off but not removed (409); Admin shows them as shipping with AUGUR, without versions to go back to or a sign-in to issue. The updater restarts Folio and its worker in an upgrade. The service kit works out a bucket key's id from its secret (`bucketKeyIdFor`), so apps need only `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. The shell's dev-app mode takes other apps beside the one being developed (`DEV_ALSO`), and the contract tests run with Folio on and off.
- a3da8c7: An intent raised for an app with a menu (from a Home card, a notification's action or another app) now opens the app to answer it, instead of stopping at the app's Orbit with the intent still waiting.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a3ba7ef: Admin → Updates can ask for an upgrade. **Upgrade to …** records the wanted release in the registry (`PUT /v1/platform/upgrade`, audited), after the admin enters their password again: the gateway now passes on when the caller last signed in (`x-user-signed-in-at`, `Caller.signedInAt`, `signedInRecently()` in the service kit), and the shell's `/auth/again?return=<path>` asks for the password and comes back. The deployment's updater (signed in as `platform-updater`) reads the upgrade from `/v1/platform/upgrade/target` and reports each step to `/v1/platform/upgrade/progress`; Updates follows along and says how it ended. An upgrade nothing has started can be cancelled.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1622cd9: The platform is now called AUGUR. Packages move from `@platform/*` to `@augur/*`, and the shell's title, `<ui-shell>`'s default product name, Admin and new sign-in realms say AUGUR. Running servers keep their realm, database, Compose project and `.env` names; see docs/upgrade.md. The shell's import map still answers to `@platform/ui-kit`, so apps built before the rename keep loading.

### Patch Changes

- 8c0a9c8: Servers run released images instead of building them. Each AUGUR release now builds, pushes and signs (cosign, keyless) the web, gateway, identity, registry, events and models images to `ghcr.io/<repo>/<part>:<version>`, and its `augur-release.json` asset names each by digest. `infra/deploy/compose.yml` runs `${PLATFORM_IMAGES}/<part>:${PLATFORM_VERSION}` (new setting `PLATFORM_VERSION`, optional `PLATFORM_IMAGES` for a mirror); `compose.build.yml` builds from the checkout instead. The images run as unprivileged users, and the web container listens on 8080. See "Images from releases" in `docs/upgrade.md`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d14956f: An app can be on for one floor and off for another. The registry keeps three separate things: whether an app is turned on at all (as before), installs per floor in a new `registry.installs` table (on or off, carrying on to the teams below unless told not to), and guardrails in `registry.guardrails`, where a block on a floor wins over anything below it. Everyone's own floor follows the org. Manifests gain `floors` (the kinds of floor an app works on) and a checked `surfaces` block (page, card, panel, settings or admin per kind of floor, with an optional role and roll-up). `GET /v1/manifest?workspace=` lists the apps on for the floor the gateway checked, and grants now hold only where an app is on. Admins set floors with `PUT /v1/apps/{id}/floors/{workspace}` and see them with `GET /v1/apps/{id}/floors`; a new version asking for more scopes is served but gets them only after `PUT /v1/apps/{id}/scopes`. Identity tells platform services where a floor sits (`GET /v1/workspaces/{id}`, read with the service kit's `floorPlaces`) and offers the roll-up `GET /v1/me/workspaces/{id}/rollup`. The shell asks for the catalogue of the floor you're on and asks again when you move. Admin, Apps shows where each app is on, floor by floor, with a choice for each, and lets an admin allow scopes a new version asks for. Services need `IDENTITY_URL` (set in both compose files).
- 7c92125: A developer kit for app builders. `pnpm create-app <id>` writes a new app (frontend, service, manifest and changeset) into `apps/<id>`. `pnpm dev:app <id>` runs it in the real shell, signed in as a stand-in person, with the app's frontend from source and its service beside it, and nothing else of the platform needed; the shell gains this as a dev-only mode (`DEV_APP`). `pnpm check:manifest` puts every app's manifest to an in-memory registry in CI, so it fails on what the registry would refuse. `docs/build-an-app.md` goes from nothing to an app in the shell. Also fixes the shell's dev server after the import map: the shared kit is built into `shared-build/` and served from there, since Vite refused to load the shell's own imports from `public/`.
- d1f8c5e: Notifications and the audit log know their floor. A service call that names a floor records it on each notification and audit entry, with the floor's path from the root as it stood then (asked of identity), so "everything under Finance" stays right after a team moves. `GET /v1/audit?workspace=` filters to a floor and the floors below it; admins read the whole log and a lead their own floor's. Team notices are opt-in per team (`PUT /v1/team-notices/{workspace}`, by its leads or an admin): `notify` with `toTeam` reaches everyone on the team as it is when sent, asked of identity's new `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}/people`. Identity records department changes on the department's floor, and the registry records floor rules on theirs. The shell tags a notification from another floor with its name, puts a dot on the gauge (and a count in Account) where something waits, and opening one goes to its floor. Admin, Activity filters by floor and says which floor an app was turned on, off or blocked for.
- 9fe54e8: Find searches apps' own content (SDK 1.3). An app that declares `"search": true` in its manifest (the registry now accepts it) answers `GET /v1/search?q=` on its service with `{ results: [{ id, title, detail?, path?, workspace? }] }` (`SearchAnswer` and `SearchResult` in the SDK). As the person types, after a short pause and from two letters, the shell asks every such app on the current floor at once, through the gateway with the floor attached. Each app's results (at most ten, the current floor's first, others tagged with their floor) show under its name after Apps and Pages as they arrive. One still answering says "Still looking…" and one that takes longer than 1.5 seconds is let go, so none holds up the rest. Choosing a result opens its app at its `path`, on its floor. `ui-shell` takes `findGroups` beside `findResults` for results grouped and still coming. The contract tests check that Find asks the reference app on the floor and opens what it answers, and that a slow app doesn't hold Find up.
- bacd56f: Floors you can see. `ui-shell` takes `floors` and `floor`: the top left shows the current floor's icon and its breadcrumb from the org (each step goes up to it), a gauge at the right edge has a notch per floor from yours to the org, Account lists every floor in place of Switch workspace, and Page Up and Page Down go up or down a floor once the page is at its top or bottom (Alt for at once). It fires `ui-floor` with `{ id, direction }`, and a new `floor` plays the move: the floor's name shows for a moment, the app fades in, and the water slides in from above or below. `ui-wave-background` gains `level` and `move(direction)`, gliding colours and height between floors (a plain cross-fade under reduced motion). New `floor-you-*`, `floor-team-*` and `floor-org-*` colour tokens (one shared team colour), an `org` icon, and `floorStack`, `floorBeside` and `floorDirection` helpers. The shell passes the person's floors to `ui-shell` and keeps you in the same app when you change floor.
- 6da9dba: Home shows what needs you (SDK 1.2). Under the greeting, a count ("3 things need you"), then every unread notification that needs you, with its actions inline (muted apps left out), then up to six glance cards in recent-app order; with nothing at all, "Nothing needs you right now". A card is an app's `card` surface for the kind of floor: the manifest's `module` names a key of the new `surfaces` on the entry's default export (`MicroFrontend.surfaces`, `Surface`, and `AppManifestEntry.surfaces` and `floors` in the SDK), and the shell mounts it with the app's own context; a card that's missing or fails says so in its tile. Home is still an app: it hears from the shell on its own `shell.home.*` bus events. The kit gains `ui-list` (rows with a lead mark, detail, time and up to two actions; groups, the first that needs you pings, loading, empty and error) and `ui-state` (empty, loading after 300ms, error, offline), and `ui-shell` fires `ui-notifications` whenever its notifications or mutes change. `pnpm dev:app` puts Home in the stand-in catalogue so an app's card can be seen, and the contract tests check Home's actions and a glance card.
- 94ea6cc: Notifications can carry actions, and the stream is grouped by app (SDK 1.2). `ctx.notify({ …, actions })` and the service kit's `notify` take up to two `{ label, intent }` buttons; pressing one in the stream raises its intent through the shell exactly as `ctx.raise` does (on the notification's own floor when it's from another) and marks it read, so no app code runs in the stream. The events service checks and keeps them (`actions` on `POST /v1/notifications`, a payload of at most 1 KB, migration `003_actions`), and sends a notification too big for Postgres's 8000-byte notify by id. The stream groups by app, apps with something that needs you first; each group's ⋯ mutes the app, which keeps its notifications in the stream silently (no pulse, not counted in the band) and saves `muted` in preferences, which identity now accepts. The contract tests check that an action raises its intent, skipping it for builds from before SDK 1.2. The kit gains `ui-menu` (a short list of actions from a button, with keys, danger last) and the `more` and `mute` icons.
- 211bd32: Settings shows what's running (the shell's version and the SDK's), through a new `version` property on `ui-shell`. The Board and Palette sample apps are gone, and the server setup no longer builds or registers them; docs/deploy.md says how to remove them from a server that has them.
- bffdd14: Apps know which floor they're on (SDK 1.1). `MountContext` gains `workspace` (the floor's id, kind, name, slug, path from the org and the person's role), `getWorkspace()` and `fetch(path, init)`, which calls the gateway with the person's token and `X-Workspace-Id`; the SDK exports `floorFetch` and the `Workspace` types. The shell loads the person's floors at sign-in, puts the floor at the start of every address (`/@me/…`, `/@finance/…`, `/@org/…`; an address without one opens on your own floor), shows "You're not on that floor" for one you can't go to, and mounts the open app again when the floor changes. The Account line shows the current floor instead of the first department. Home names the floor over its greeting, except on your own. `pnpm dev:app` puts you on your own floor, with the org's at `/@org/…`; the contract tests check `ctx.workspace` and `ctx.fetch`, skipping them for builds from before SDK 1.1.
- 9681bff: The shell serves the UI kit and Lit once, through an import map, and the shell and every app share that copy. Apps' builds leave `lit`, `lit/*` and `@augur/ui-kit` external using `isSharedModule` from the new `@augur/mfe-sdk/build`, which lists exactly what the shell provides. Home's bundle drops from 208 KB to 1 KB and Admin's from 266 KB to 59 KB. The kit goes to 1.0.0 and keeps the SDK's versioning promise: within SDK 1.x the shell serves kit 1.x and Lit 3.x, and a breaking kit change ships with an SDK major.
- 778157a: Shell alpha: settings, Away and recent apps save to each person's account through a new Identity preferences API (`/v1/me/preferences`); Find also searches every app's menu pages and opens them; Agents, Switch workspace and the unbuilt Admin app are hidden until they exist. The UI kit adds `reducedMotion()`, which honours `data-motion="reduce"` on `<html>`, and `canSwitchWorkspace` on `ui-shell`.

### Patch Changes

- b92585d: Admin app for people, departments and apps, so nobody needs Keycloak's console. Identity gains an admin API (`/v1/admin/people`, `/departments`, `/roles`) that manages people, roles and departments in Keycloak and audits every change; an admin can't turn off their own sign-in or remove their own admin role. The registry lists the whole catalogue for admins (`GET /v1/apps`) and lets them turn an app off and on (`PATCH /v1/apps/:id`); an app that is off stays off when it registers again. Admin now appears for admins. The UI kit adds `ui-select`, `ui-toggle` and `ui-checkbox-group`, four icons (`user-plus`, `department`, `key`, `plus`), and dialogs scroll inside instead of running off the screen.
- 8b41beb: Contract tests: a reference app that uses every part of the mount context, opened in the real shell in a browser and checked, both as built today and as built against each earlier SDK minor (kept in `platform/contract/frozen/`, starting with 1.0). A CI job runs them, so a shell or SDK change that breaks an app fails CI. The shell's dev-app mode takes `DEV_APP_ENTRY` to mount a built entry instead of the source.
- 6543ced: The shell accepts a path for `VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY` (like `/sso/realms/platform`), resolved against the address it is served from, so one build works behind any hostname. Adds `infra/deploy`: the whole platform in Docker Compose on one server, reached over Tailscale (see docs/deploy.md).
- 1981198: Apps can only load from allowed places. The registry refuses an app whose entry is a full address on a site an admin hasn't allowed (`/v1/origins`, audited as `origin.allowed` and `origin.removed`), and stops offering apps from a site once it's removed, marking them `blocked` in the catalogue. Admin's Apps screen gains "Where apps load from" to add and remove sites, and shows blocked apps. The shell's page is served with a Content Security Policy: scripts only from the platform, its import map and the sites in `APP_ORIGINS`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b705f16: Version the HTTP APIs and report releases on health. Each service's API now lives under `/v1` (through the gateway, `/api/<service>/v1/...`), matching its OpenAPI contract's major version, and `GET /healthz` answers with the service's release and API version. The registry requires every app to say which SDK releases it works with (`sdk`, a semver range) and a semver `version`; the shell won't open an app whose range its SDK doesn't satisfy, and says why.
