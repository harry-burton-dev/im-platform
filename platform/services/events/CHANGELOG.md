# @augur/events

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 656f2d1: Leavers' accounts are deleted once the organisation's leaver retention has passed (ADR 0072). Identity checks every five minutes and, in an order it can resume, has Activity remove their personal values, forgets their preferences and teams, and deletes the Keycloak account; then it records `person.deleted`, which followers hear as `platform.person.deleted` (`PLATFORM_TOPICS.personDeleted`). A deployment admin who just entered their password can delete a leaver's account at once (`DELETE /v1/admin/people/{id}`). People shows when a leaver's account goes (contract 1.30.0, migration `lifecycle_005_deletion`).
- 699af61: Followers can't miss an event, and leavers can't be lost. Publishers take turns on a lock only the events login can touch, so seq order is commit order and a long transaction elsewhere no longer stalls followers. An audit entry, its domain event, and each inbox step are one transaction, and `recordAudit` sends an `Idempotency-Key`, so a retry keeps one entry (contract 1.15.0, migrations `013_one_write_each`, `014_forget_notes`). The events channels carry ids only and ignore anything else. A night identity can't give Activity's retention removes nothing. A leaver's team items that couldn't go back are retried. Leaving now and Delete now answer 503 when Activity can't be reached and carry on within five minutes, and a heir who can't sign in any more is passed over and admins told. Deletion also takes a leaver's note (`note` is in `PERSONAL_DETAIL_KEYS`), the notice that they asked to leave, their inbox notes and open items, and, in the registry, their name on upgrades (`GET /v1/people/{id}/data`, contract 1.36.0, migrations `022_followed_events`, `lifecycle_006_carry_on`). Entra's first sign-in no longer links an account holding a two-step role, and a flow that isn't whole is rebuilt. A removed app can't publish a frontend. Gateway refusals use an app's name, not its id. The service kit adds `followLeavers`, `readPersonLeft`, `readPersonDeleted`, `eventCursor`, `EVENT_CURSOR_TABLE_SQL` and `leaveNoticeKey`; the outbox keeps `refused_at` and `refused_why`. Followers keep their place past events they don't follow (`next`). No app has to change.
- 1ce4194: Urgent news (ADR 0044 D3, PER-283). A notification can be `urgent`, from AUGUR's own services only (an app's is refused, 403). The Upgrade Centre marks a halted release and a go-back that didn't finish urgent, and offers a feature preview, `urgent-letterbox`: with it on, the shell opens urgent news in a see-through letterbox over the work, one at a time with the rest in its queue, and steps it back to the edge rule until someone opens it. Events contract 1.14.0.

  Not breaking: `NewNotification.urgent` in `@augur/service-kit` is a new optional field, so existing callers build and send as before.

### Patch Changes

- c58df31: Domain-event streams end after a few minutes so the gateway checks the person again. Inbox actions are refused when the item changed since it was checked, overlapping email runs no longer send twice, and each published event is checked against the floor it names.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 4cfab7e: Jobs start with a login that can't create schemas, as every service and app has on a server. DBOS's first step, `create schema if not exists`, is refused by Postgres from such a login even when the storage service has already made the schema, so the events service didn't start on 0.23.0. The kit now records that step as done when the schema is there.
- Updated dependencies [4cfab7e]
  - @augur/service-kit@0.17.1

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b58f5f: The Inbox's Done tab looks back `INBOX_DONE_DAYS` days (30 by default) instead of a fixed 30. `GET /v1/inbox/counts` now says the window as `doneDays` (events API 1.12.0), and the shell's empty Done tab reads its number from there instead of repeating it.
- 5397ee5: Daily and weekly digests: each person who chose one gets an email at 08:00 their time (Mondays for weekly) gathering
  what they haven't read and weren't already emailed, after their quiet hours, never twice for one morning.
- 1a8561d: The events service emails people the notifications that need them, as they chose in Account → Notifications: not
  when email is off, the app is muted or the kind is Quiet, and after their quiet hours. From the organisation's
  sender, in their language, with a link back to the notification. The service kit's notice template takes a `lang`.

### Patch Changes

- 6ec3e70: What these services say as they start, and the storage and realm jobs as they run, goes through the service kit's `startupLog` instead of `console`: the same JSON lines as the rest of their logs, sent to the deployment's telemetry stack with them.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- d88842e: The events service keeps everything in Postgres, locally too: the in-memory copies of its event and inbox stores are gone, and it won't start without `DATABASE_URL`. Its tests run on real Postgres (PER-271).
- Updated dependencies [833b4ed]
- Updated dependencies [431db38]
  - @augur/service-kit@0.15.0

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- eac9902: Account gets Privacy and data: download a copy of what AUGUR keeps about you (identity `GET /me/data`, with events' notifications, inbox and Activity from `GET /v1/people/{id}/data`), see who sees what about you, and ask to leave or take it back (`/me/leave`; admins are told once). Part of PER-193.
- 1f83a5f: Activity can be filtered by target, person and kind (sign-ins or changes), downloaded as CSV or JSON lines (admins, at most 366 days at a time), keeps entries for the organisation's retention period (365 days by default, pruned nightly), and identity can remove a deleted person's personal values from it. Service kit adds `PERSONAL_DETAIL_KEYS` and `REMOVED`.
- f6629c4: Someone who leaves a team, or whose sign-in is turned off, gives back the team inbox items they had taken: they're open to the team again, written to the audit log, and published as `platform.inbox.released` with `left: true`.
- 866c076: The leaver flow and signing out everywhere (ADR 0040, part of PER-194). Turning someone's sign-in off now signs them out everywhere at once: every Keycloak session and every offline token an app holds for them. Admin → People gets "They're leaving": their sign-in goes off, they're signed out, and identity records `person.left`, which the events service publishes as `platform.person.left` `{ person, handOverTo? }` so apps hand on what the leaver owns (`PLATFORM_TOPICS.personLeft`). People marks who asked to leave in their account, and the leaver flow closes the request (`GET /admin/leave-requests`, `POST /admin/people/{id}/leave`, identity contract 1.22.0). Guide: docs/people.md.
- 04d7ed1: Choosing notifications per kind (ADR 0036). The events service keeps a notification's `kind` and refuses one the app's manifest doesn't declare (migration 008). Identity's preferences keep `quietKinds` (`<app>:<kind>`). Account, Notifications lists each app's kinds, On Home or Quiet, and the shell lands a quiet kind in the stream without a pulse, uncounted, off Home and with no toast (Aerie 0.7.0). The service kit's `NewNotification` and `AppNotice` take `kind`.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2dbdc22: Apps hear more of what changes about people (PER-148). `platform.person.joined` when an admin adds someone, and `platform.person.changed` (`{ person, changed }`, naming which of `name`, `email`, `roles` and `teams` changed, never the values) when an admin changes their details. Every team someone joins or leaves is now `platform.team.member-added` or `-removed` on that team's floor, also when it happened by adding the person or changing their list of teams, which before sent nothing; each is in that floor's Activity too. `PLATFORM_TOPICS` names the two new topics. See docs/domain-events.md.
- 0ec750c: The Inbox's items (ADR 0026, PER-146): apps' services put work that waits on a person or a team in their inbox with the new `inbox:write` scope (`inboxItem`, `updateInboxItem`, `getInboxItem` in the service kit), keyed by the app's own id, and close it when it's done or withdraw it. People list theirs (`/v1/inbox`, `/v1/inbox/counts`) and take, release, decline, hand on or mark done; each step is in the item's history and the audit log, and published as `platform.inbox.*`. The notification stream also carries `inbox` events, so the shell's count stays live. Closed items are kept `INBOX_KEEP_DAYS` (90) days. Admin names the scope "Put work in people's inboxes". Events API 1.9.0.
- 7518ce8: Apps declare the kinds of work they put in people's inboxes in their manifest's `inbox.kinds` (SDK 1.12: `id`, `label`, `icon`, up to 10), and the events service refuses an item of a kind the app doesn't declare. The registry names them in an app's grants (`inboxKinds`), read with `registryInboxKinds` from the service kit. The SDK gains the Inbox's types (`InboxItem`, `InboxKind`, `InboxCounts`, `InboxChange`) and `INBOX_TOPICS`.

### Patch Changes

- 46619f9: The events API's schemas are TypeBox, and contracts/events.openapi.yaml is generated from them (ADR 0055). The contract now names the refusals the routes already sent.
- 03e7d87: Every deployment setting is described once, in infra/deploy/settings.schema.json, and CI checks compose.yml, .env.example, the guides and the services' code against it (`pnpm check:settings`). Settings the guides named but compose never passed now reach their services: FEED_SIGNER (registry), IMAGE_SIGNER, IMAGE_SIGNER_ISSUER and AUGUR_DEV_SIGNER (updater), DOMAIN_EVENTS_KEEP_DAYS (events), MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (models), CALLER_SIGNING_KEY (gateway), and OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS, OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER and OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG (every service). An empty DOMAIN_EVENTS_KEEP_DAYS or MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS keeps its default, and AUGUR_DEV_SIGNER follows the repository a fork's IMAGE_SIGNER names.
- 566f261: The service kit has one migration runner, `runMigrations(pool, { schema, migrations })`, and the events, identity, models and registry services use it in place of their own copies; what they do at start is unchanged. New migrations are linted with Squawk (ADR 0053), which catches drops, renames and type changes the old check missed.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 64e6ed8: Domain events reach the browser: `GET /v1/domain-events/stream?topics=` streams each event on the person's floor and topics as it's published (events contract 1.8.0), so apps can refresh what they show without polling.

### Patch Changes

- 9ff1791: The events API's schemas are TypeBox, and contracts/events.openapi.yaml is generated from them (ADR 0055). The contract now names the refusals the routes already sent.
- b3060e0: Every platform service answers errors as RFC 9457 problem details (`application/problem+json`) with AUGUR's `reason` and `whoCanChange`, and keeps `error` and `message` for SDK 1.x clients. The service kit adds `problemDetails()`, `Problem`, `sendProblem` and `serviceFastifyOptions()`. A service's unexpected errors are logged and answered with a plain 500, never with their own words.
- 8d48714: Fixes from the 2 Nov audit. In Admin → People, a person's sign-in (on or off, a new one-time password) sits in its own section that says it takes effect at once: each asks first, acts straight away and says what happened, while their name, email, department and roles change only on Save. Agents stay among the Shell's functions and say they aren't here yet, and Home keeps the card of an app this shell can't open, saying why and who can change it, instead of hiding either. Messages people read say AUGUR, not "the platform", and `pnpm check:reasons` now catches it. The centre menu's transitions stop for AUGUR's own reduced-motion setting as well as the system's and are timed from motion tokens; the lifecycle's divider uses the hairline token; overlay shadows use the shadow token. A new test holds the Lit kit and AUGUR's frontends to tokens only.
- Updated dependencies [b3060e0]
  - @augur/service-kit@0.12.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e98ef1: Every audit entry now keeps `recordedBy`: the service that wrote it, taken from its signed token. An app can still name any actor, but the entry shows which app made the claim. Entries written before this have no `recordedBy`.
- 2021f8a: Deployment admins now hear in the shell when a new AUGUR or app release is available, and deployment admins and admins hear when an upgrade or install finishes, fails or goes back by itself (ADR 0044). Platform services can address a notification to an `audience` such as `role:deployment-admin`, worked out by identity as it's sent, and any sender can give one a `key` so each person is told that news once (events contract 1.7.0, identity contract 1.14.0).

### Patch Changes

- 23a2f8f: Each platform service and Keycloak connects to Postgres with its own login, which owns only its own schema (Keycloak: its own database). The storage job makes the logins from `PLATFORM_DATABASE_LOGINS` and the `*_DATABASE_PASSWORD` settings, and hands each one what its service made as the admin login. The services make their schema only when it isn't there, since their own logins may not create schemas.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- ea41136: Services stay up through a Postgres restart: a dropped idle connection is logged (`steadyPool` in the service kit) rather than ending the process, and the events service listens again on a new connection, so open notification streams don't go quiet for good.
- Updated dependencies [ea41136]
  - @augur/service-kit@0.10.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f0d02e2: Floor rules for apps are domain events too: `platform.app.blocked` when an admin blocks an app on a floor and those below it, and `platform.app.rule-cleared` when a floor goes back to following the one above. `PLATFORM_TOPICS` names them.

  - @augur/service-kit@0.9.0

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- aa1724a: Services check their settings before they start. The service kit's `loadConfig` takes a list of the settings a service reads (`Setting`, plus `commonSettings` for the ones services share). In production, a missing required setting stops the service with one message listing every problem, instead of falling back to a `localhost` address. A secret can be given as a file in `<NAME>_FILE`. `describeConfig` reports each setting and where it came from, never a secret's value, ready for Admin → Deployment.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a09b413: Domain events: services tell each other what happened. The events service keeps events on topics (`folio.document.published`), which an app publishes on its own topics with the new `events:publish` scope, and hands them out in one order, never with a gap, to services with `events:subscribe`. It publishes the platform's own (`platform.person.disabled`, `platform.team.member-added`, `platform.app.turned-off` and more) as identity and the registry record those changes. The service kit adds an outbox (`OUTBOX_TABLE_SQL`, `addToOutbox`, `outboxRelay`) so an event is sent if and only if its change commits, `followEvents` for followers, `publishEvents` and `PLATFORM_TOPICS`. Admin names the two new scopes. Events are kept 30 days. See docs/domain-events.md.
- b90f63b: Signed caller: the gateway signs the person it passes on (`x-augur-caller`, Ed25519, one minute, one service as audience) and publishes its key at `/api/gateway/v1/caller-keys`. The service kit's `signedCallers` hook drops unsigned `x-user-*` headers and puts back only the signed caller; the platform's services and new apps use it.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c0a9c8: Servers run released images instead of building them. Each AUGUR release now builds, pushes and signs (cosign, keyless) the web, gateway, identity, registry, events and models images to `ghcr.io/<repo>/<part>:<version>`, and its `augur-release.json` asset names each by digest. `infra/deploy/compose.yml` runs `${PLATFORM_IMAGES}/<part>:${PLATFORM_VERSION}` (new setting `PLATFORM_VERSION`, optional `PLATFORM_IMAGES` for a mirror); `compose.build.yml` builds from the checkout instead. The images run as unprivileged users, and the web container listens on 8080. See "Images from releases" in `docs/upgrade.md`.
- 1622cd9: The platform is now called AUGUR. Packages move from `@platform/*` to `@augur/*`, and the shell's title, `<ui-shell>`'s default product name, Admin and new sign-in realms say AUGUR. Running servers keep their realm, database, Compose project and `.env` names; see docs/upgrade.md. The shell's import map still answers to `@platform/ui-kit`, so apps built before the rename keep loading.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c40b827: Activity in Admin: the audit log, readable. Events' `GET /v1/audit` gains `since` and `until` (a time range) and `before` (the id of the oldest entry shown, for the next page); API 1.1.0. Admin's new Activity screen, under Platform, lists every change newest first as a sentence ("Alex Rivera added Sam Okafor to Finance"), filters by who, where and when (today, 7 days, 30 days, any time, or between two dates), shows 50 at a time with Show older, and opens any change to see everything recorded about it.
- 2abdd1d: Apps sign in to the platform as themselves. An admin issues an app's own sign-in with `POST /v1/admin/apps/{id}/credential` on identity, which makes (or gives a new secret to) the Keycloak client `app-<id>`: client credentials only, 5-minute tokens for the `platform-services` audience, audited without the secret. The app's service gets it as `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`; the service kit's `appCredentialsFromEnv`, `clientCredentials` and `serviceVerifier` sign in and check those tokens, and `notify`, `recordAudit` and `callService` can name the floor a call is for. Manifests gain `scopes` (`notifications:send`, `audit:write`). The registry lets an app register only itself, and tells platform services what an app is granted (`GET /v1/apps/{id}/grants?workspace=`): for now, what its manifest asks for on every floor, and nothing while it is off. Events lets an app notify and write the audit log only for itself and only with the scope on the call's floor (403 otherwise, 503 while it can't be checked), keeping each answer for 30 seconds. The shared `SERVICE_TOKEN` still works for now. The Library and new apps from `pnpm create-app` sign in as themselves when they have a secret.
- d1f8c5e: Notifications and the audit log know their floor. A service call that names a floor records it on each notification and audit entry, with the floor's path from the root as it stood then (asked of identity), so "everything under Finance" stays right after a team moves. `GET /v1/audit?workspace=` filters to a floor and the floors below it; admins read the whole log and a lead their own floor's. Team notices are opt-in per team (`PUT /v1/team-notices/{workspace}`, by its leads or an admin): `notify` with `toTeam` reaches everyone on the team as it is when sent, asked of identity's new `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}/people`. Identity records department changes on the department's floor, and the registry records floor rules on theirs. The shell tags a notification from another floor with its name, puts a dot on the gauge (and a count in Account) where something waits, and opening one goes to its floor. Admin, Activity filters by floor and says which floor an app was turned on, off or blocked for.
- 94ea6cc: Notifications can carry actions, and the stream is grouped by app (SDK 1.2). `ctx.notify({ …, actions })` and the service kit's `notify` take up to two `{ label, intent }` buttons; pressing one in the stream raises its intent through the shell exactly as `ctx.raise` does (on the notification's own floor when it's from another) and marks it read, so no app code runs in the stream. The events service checks and keeps them (`actions` on `POST /v1/notifications`, a payload of at most 1 KB, migration `003_actions`), and sends a notification too big for Postgres's 8000-byte notify by id. The stream groups by app, apps with something that needs you first; each group's ⋯ mutes the app, which keeps its notifications in the stream silently (no pulse, not counted in the band) and saves `muted` in preferences, which identity now accepts. The contract tests check that an action raises its intent, skipping it for builds from before SDK 1.2. The kit gains `ui-menu` (a short list of actions from a button, with keys, danger last) and the `more` and `mute` icons.
- 0295651: The shared `SERVICE_TOKEN` is gone: every app and platform service signs in as itself. The service kit drops `SERVICE_TOKEN_HEADER`, `serviceFromHeaders` and `withoutServiceHeaders`; `ServiceCredentials` is now a name and a token source, and `platformCredentialsFromEnv` signs a platform service in as `platform-<name>`. Identity makes each platform service's Keycloak client (and the Library's, locally) from `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRETS` when it starts, retrying until Keycloak is up. The registry and events accept only signed-in services; events asks the registry for grants as `platform-events`. `pnpm register-app` signs in as the app. Admin, Apps shows what each app may do and issues a new sign-in, showing its secret once. The deploy needs `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REGISTRY_CLIENT_SECRET` and `EVENTS_CLIENT_SECRET` in place of `SERVICE_TOKEN` (see docs/upgrade.md).

### Patch Changes

- 6a64067: Security fixes from the code review. The gateway checks sign-in on every path but `/healthz`, by the route a request matched rather than its raw URL, so a percent-encoded path such as `/%61pi/library/…` can no longer skip the check. It no longer forwards the person's `Authorization` header to any service; services already get the caller in `x-user-*` headers. `APP_UPSTREAMS` may not name a platform service. The registry refuses an app route inside or around another app's route (`/admin/people` would have taken over Admin's People page). Events treats an `X-Workspace-Id` that won't URI-decode as an unknown floor (400) instead of failing with 500.
- 4c96907: Backups are proven, not only taken. Once a week (and on first start) the backup container restores the newest backup into a throwaway database, checks the platform's tables and Keycloak's people came back, and records the result; `backup.sh --restore-test` runs one now. The gateway reads the last backup and restore test from `BACKUP_DIR` and adds them to `GET /api/gateway/v1/status` (API 1.1.0); Admin's Status shows them and its heading says "Backups need a look" when one failed or is overdue. Every request now carries one id from nginx through the gateway to each service: service-kit's `serviceLogging()` labels every log line with `requestId`, and the gateway returns it in `x-request-id`. New guide: `docs/upgrade.md`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b705f16: Version the HTTP APIs and report releases on health. Each service's API now lives under `/v1` (through the gateway, `/api/<service>/v1/...`), matching its OpenAPI contract's major version, and `GET /healthz` answers with the service's release and API version. The registry requires every app to say which SDK releases it works with (`sdk`, a semver range) and a semver `version`; the shell won't open an app whose range its SDK doesn't satisfy, and says why.
